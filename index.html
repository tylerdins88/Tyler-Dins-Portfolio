                <p>My name is Tyler Dinslage. I am a entry level full stack web developer. I aim to grow as a developer
                    and
                    make coding an instinctive trait. This page will continue to update as I create and deploy new
                    applications. I invite you to follow me on my journey of learning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Most people call me "Dins". I am from Nebraska originally. I have lived in Colorado, but now reside
                    in
                    the Lake Tahoe, California area. I graduated from the University of Nebraska in May of 2011 with a
                    double bachelor degree in Finance and Economics. Upon graduation was when I moved the the Colorado
                    Rockies. There I became a avid snowboarder and adventuresman. I have worked a variety of jobs
                    including
                    Property Management, Accounting, Home Remodeling, Sales at Lowe's, and Snowmaking! In the fall of
                    2020,
                    I moved to California. Here I continued making snow and was also a snow groomer. I recently decided
                    I
                    was ready to start a new chapter & career! That is what brought me to coding!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>More personally, I am huge fan of the outdoors. Along with snowboarding; I enjoy hiking, golfing,
                    paddleboarding, and hanging at the beach. I have a dog named Leo whom I've had for over 14 years!
                    When I
                    am not outdoors I enjoy cooking good food and playing board games. Cribbage and Settlers of Catan
                    are
                    two of my favorite games. I also like to go to concerts, travel to new cities, and go camping.

                <p> Listed here are my beginning webpages and projects. I made these to teach myself how to code. Each
                    one builds on previous work.
                    I am learning new techniques everyday and applying them.
